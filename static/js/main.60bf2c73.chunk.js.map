Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket, named for America's first\r\n            astronaut, launched from rural West Texas on the 52nd anniversary of\r\n            the Apollo 11 moon landing, a date picked by Bezos for its\r\n            historical importance.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Even though Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic pushed forward his\r\n            own trip from New Mexico in the battle for space tourist cash, he\r\n            stuck to it and beat him to space by nine days. Unlike Branson's\r\n            piloted rocket jet, Bezos' capsule was fully automated, requiring no\r\n            official personnel on board for the 10-minute up-and-down journey.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Blue Origin aimed for an altitude of 66 miles (106 kilometres),\r\n            which would be more than 10 miles (16 kilometres) higher than\r\n            Branson's July 11 voyage. To get the capsule high enough, the\r\n            60-foot (18-meter) booster sped to Mach 3, or three times the speed\r\n            of sound, before separating and aiming for a vertical landing.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The passengers were expected to get three to four minutes of\r\n            weightlessness to float around the spacious white capsule. Then the\r\n            window-filled capsule was going to head to a parachute touchdown on\r\n            the desert floor, with Bezos and his guests briefly experiencing\r\n            nearly six times the force of gravity, or 6 G’s, on the way back.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Sharing Bezos’ dream-come-true adventure was Wally Funk, from the\r\n            Dallas area, one of 13 female pilots who went through the same tests\r\n            as NASA’s all-male astronaut corps in the early 1960s but never made\r\n            it into space. Joining them on the ultimate joyride was the\r\n            company’s first paying customer, Oliver Daemen, a last-minute\r\n            fill-in for the mystery winner of a $28 million auction who opted\r\n            for a later flight. The Dutch teen’s father took part in the\r\n            auction, and agreed on a lower undisclosed price last week when Blue\r\n            Origin offered his son the vacated seat.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default HomeDetail;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport two from \"./2.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst HomeDetail2 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg src={two} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                Iran launches ‘halal’ dating app\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            According to a report on Iranian state media, they are planning to\r\n            create an official halal dating app, claiming that they built the\r\n            software with the goal of benefitting their young for \"long and\r\n            informed marriage.\"\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            According to the broadcaster, they dubbed this apto benefitp\r\n            \"Hamdam,\" a Farsi word that means \"partner,\" and it would let\r\n            potential users to locate and pick their spouse.

Apple has been criticised by\r\n            Spain's Consumer Protection Organization OCU (via 9to5Mac) for\r\n            strangling the performance of the iPhone 12, iPhone 11, iPhone XS,\r\n            and iPhone 8 with iOS 14.5, iOS 14.5.1, and iOS 14.6 upgrades.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            They said that the gadgets experienced corrupted battery life and\r\n            performance in the wake of introducing the updates. The OCU needs\r\n            Apple to resolve the issue and remunerate affected clients likewise.\r\n            It is hazy what is the issue, and it influenced the number of\r\n            clients.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Previously, it was claimed that the iPhone XR was receiving a lot of\r\n            attention after receiving the iOS 14.5.1 upgrade. In certain created\r\n            benchmarks, it performed similarly to the iPhone 12 and even\r\n            outperformed the iPhone 11. Given that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone\r\n            12 functioned well within spec, there was no reason to make any\r\n            assumptions. All things considered, the news was good for the iPhone\r\n            XR clients as their gadgets got a fresh chance to take life by the\r\n            horns.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Surprisingly, the OCU cites \"media reports\" as a basis for the\r\n            alleged delay. There is hardly no information about it in the\r\n            international press. Perhaps the situation differs from what is\r\n            reported in Spanish media. The upgrades are likely to have affected\r\n            just a small number of iPhones in Spain. Given that the lead iPhone\r\n            12 series is rumoured to have had a presentation halt, it's a topic\r\n            worth investigating. More insights regarding the case ought to arise\r\n            once the suit goes to court, which appears to be unavoidable now.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default HomeDetail3;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport four from \"./4.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst HomeDetail5 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg src={four} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                HOW TO GET FREE AIRPODS WITH MAC AND IPAD\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Despite their premium pricing, Apple's goods have always been\r\n            remarkable.

They've even\r\n            started rolling out the Windows 11 Insider Preview on the developer\r\n            channel after a week. Many users who followed our prior instructions\r\n            on Windows 11 Insider Preview have already begun using the new\r\n            release. However, Microsoft has imposed several perplexing\r\n            restrictions, preventing many PCs from running Windows 11. So if you\r\n            guys want to experience Windows 11’s look and feel, you can do it on\r\n            your Windows 10 system. In this article, we will discuss how to make\r\n            Windows 10 look like Windows 11. Also, if you are bored with the\r\n            Windows 10 visuals, then also you can try this. This article will\r\n            give your Windows 10 a full makeover.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Currently, the operating system is only accessible as part of a\r\n            developer-focused Preview. Sign up for Microsoft's Windows Insider\r\n            programme to get the Windows 11 Preview, but most people should just\r\n            wait for the consumer release. Of course, you might be curious as to\r\n            when you can get your hands on Windows 11 for yourself. Or, exactly\r\n            what’s new in the operating system. Here’s everything you need to\r\n            know about Microsoft’s next operating system.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Windows 11 introduces a slew of exciting new features that have the\r\n            potential to dramatically transform your Windows experience. Here\r\n            are a few of our favourite features that are available. Changes in\r\n            appearance You'll probably notice aesthetic changes to the operating\r\n            system before diving into any technological features. The fact that\r\n            the Start Menu and Task Bar are now in the centre of the screen is\r\n            perhaps the most noticeable change.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Apple allowed iOS apps to work on macOS, and now Microsoft is making\r\n            a similar change — by bringing Android apps to Windows 11. But the\r\n            way Microsoft is doing this is a little strange — it has partnered\r\n            with Amazon to bring the Amazon Appstore inside the newly revamped\r\n            Microsoft Store. In other words, you’ll be limited in the Android\r\n            apps that you can actually install on your computer. Thankfully,\r\n            Windows 11 does allow sideloading Android apps.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default HomeDetail6;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport seven from \"./7.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst HomeDetail7 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg src={seven} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                Imports of mobile phones increased by more than 50% in FY21\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Overall telecom imports into the country increased by 39.33 percent\r\n            from $1.861 billion in 2019-20 to $2.593 billion in 2020-21 during\r\n            the study period (July-June).

Outside of\r\n            the Black community, wig-wearing among white women was almost\r\n            exclusively reserved for fancy dress parties, religious practices,\r\n            or as a solution for hair loss. Wigs previously held connotations of\r\n            beauty deception, masking your identity, or false advertising, but\r\n            in the last ten years attitudes have rapidly changed. For many, wigs\r\n            have now become the new handbag – a carefully curated accessory worn\r\n            to elevate any outfit. A high quality, custom wig can be worth\r\n            thousands, making them a newfound status symbol in popular culture.\r\n            While Black women have been wearing wigs for decades – think Lil’\r\n            Kim and Nicki Minaj – the hair industry experienced serious growth\r\n            when celebrities such as Paris Hilton and the Kardashian-Jenner clan\r\n            began normalising the practice among white women. These high-level\r\n            pop culture names routinely display their wig collections online and\r\n            don colourful inches on the red carpet.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Instagram has been flooded with wig artists, armed with knowledge\r\n            and skill to produce custom wigs for anyone willing to pay a healthy\r\n            price. This shift of wig-wearing from taboo into the mainstream has\r\n            led to the global wig industry to be worth an estimated £7.9 billion\r\n            by 2023. So, as the demand for human hair wigs continues to grow and\r\n            temporary long-flowing locks become a fashion statement, it begs the\r\n            question: where does the hair come from? The not-so-glamourous truth\r\n            is that a large majority of the hair on sale in beauty supply stores\r\n            and salons comes from the poorest communities of Asia and eastern\r\n            Europe. Agents visit these countries, targeting poverty-stricken\r\n            women who exchange their hair for only a couple of pounds, which\r\n            will later be resold on the other side of the world for thousands.\r\n            Despite these regions sharing the view of long locks as a beauty\r\n            standard, women in deprived areas have little choice but to part\r\n            with their hair in order to support their families.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Reports of women in India being pressured by their husbands to sell\r\n            their hair is not uncommon. In some cases, women are further\r\n            exploited, being held down while their hair is chopped, stolen, and\r\n            sold overseas without any financial return. These exploitative\r\n            practices sharply contrast the image presented in popular culture,\r\n            with wigs adorning the heads of the world’s most powerful, wealthy,\r\n            and influential women. An alternative to human hair is synthetic\r\n            wigs, and while these offer a more affordable solution to the issue,\r\n            they cannot be styled using heat. Efforts in sustainability question\r\n            the practice of buying synthetic wigs, as they are primarily made\r\n            from non-recyclable materials such as polyester, polyvinyl, or\r\n            acrylic. This leaves celebrities, influencers, and stylists to\r\n            choose between two evils ­– if it bothers them at all.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default StyleDetail;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport twelve from \"./12.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst StyleDetail2 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/style\">Style</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg className=\"detail-img\" src={twelve} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle>\r\n                it’s pretty standard to see a lengthy list of ingredients on\r\n                almost every item\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row  justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9 \">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Researchers have found signs of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl\r\n            substances that can cause lasting damage to health and the\r\n            environment in more than half of 231 product samples. When shopping\r\n            for cosmetics, it’s pretty standard to see a lengthy list of\r\n            ingredients on almost every item, but a recent study has uncovered\r\n            that some of those listed might be more dangerous than you’d expect.\r\n            PFAS (which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances often\r\n            used in the manufacture of food packaging, clothing, and stain\r\n            resistant) are notorious for how toxic they can be in small doses,\r\n            linked to widespread health and environmental issues. Now, they’ve\r\n            been found in more than half of 231 products produced by major\r\n            beauty brands including L’Oréal, Mac, Clinique, Maybelline, Nars,\r\n            and Estée Lauder (to name a few).\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Known as ‘forever chemicals’ because of how long they persist in\r\n            both our bodies and the planet, PFAS don’t break down naturally.\r\n            Instead, they accumulate over time, wreaking havoc on our wellbeing\r\n            and bringing us ever-closer to the brink of climate destruction.\r\n            Though fashion has long been at the forefront of our concerns\r\n            regarding problematic waste build-up (the clothes and accessories we\r\n            obsess over and promptly forget about can take decades and sometimes\r\n            even centuries to decompose) the recent discovery has raised alarm\r\n            bells among experts. The peer-reviewed analysis, published in\r\n            Environmental Science & Technology, detected ‘high’ levels of\r\n            organic fluorine – an indicator of PFAS – in a staggering amount of\r\n            tested samples from waterproof mascara (82%) and eyeliner to\r\n            foundation (63%) and liquid lipstick (63%).\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Even though Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic pushed forward his\r\n            own trip from New Mexico in the battle for space tourist cash, he\r\n            stuck to it and beat him to space by nine days. Unlike Branson's\r\n            piloted rocket jet, Bezos' capsule was fully automated, requiring no\r\n            official personnel on board for the 10-minute up-and-down journey.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Exposure to PFAS, which are highly mobile and can be absorbed\r\n            through the skin, by tear ducts, or ingested, is able to impair the\r\n            immune system, increase levels of cholesterol as well as the risk of\r\n            kidney and testicular cancer, and cause high blood pressure or\r\n            preeclampsia in pregnancy For this reason, it’s understandable why\r\n            researchers are so disturbed by the findings. ‘This is the first\r\n            study to look at total fluorine or PFAS in cosmetics so we just\r\n            didn’t know what we were going to find,’ says senior scientist with\r\n            Green Science Policy Institute, Tom Bruton.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default StyleDetail2;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport thirteen from \"./13.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst StyleDetail3 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/style\">Style</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg className=\"detail-img\" src={thirteen} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle>\r\n                An outlandish concept that successfully tackles growing concerns\r\n                of sustainability\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row  justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9 \">\r\n          <p>\r\n            An outlandish concept that successfully tackles growing concerns of\r\n            sustainability, is being able to download and print out our garments\r\n            the answer to over-consumption? When you think about constructing a\r\n            three-dimensional object from a digital file, being able to print an\r\n            entire outfit might not necessarily be the first thing that springs\r\n            to mind. This new technology has been making waves across the\r\n            fashion industry recently, however, provoking serious discussion\r\n            around our over-consumption habits. Originally developed in the 80s,\r\n            Design for Additive Manufacturing (as it’s officially referred to)\r\n            is a process whereby successive layers of material are laid down in\r\n            the form of liquid, powdered plastic, metal, or cement until they\r\n            are eventually fused together into a physical item.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Not only does this have the potential to transform how products find\r\n            their way into the hands of consumers – and has been progressively\r\n            doing so for some time now, namely in the form of food, custom art,\r\n            and footwear – but the environmental benefits are endless. Imagine\r\n            this: each week, instead of falling victim to the time-old (and\r\n            often incorrect) statement that ‘you have nothing to wear,’ you have\r\n            access to a brand-new wardrobe of clothes that fit you perfectly,\r\n            align with your tastes, and are suited to whatever you have planned.\r\n            No, you’re not an influencer receiving brand deals left and right,\r\n            you’re just in possession of a not-so distant personalised,\r\n            adaptive, and sustainable reality experts believe to be the future\r\n            of dressing. It’s straightforward really. Using a collection of raw\r\n            materials, you can print out your favourite looks on-demand. When\r\n            you need a fresh fit, you melt them down and start again. Gone are\r\n            the days of ordering a bunch of stuff online only to return it a few\r\n            days later, now from the comfort of your own home, you can stay up\r\n            to date with the latest style or trend while keeping waste to a\r\n            minimum.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The ideal – and fundamentally innovative – solution, it seems, to\r\n            our toxic hype obsession, an obsession that saw one in ten Brits\r\n            admit to buying clothes ‘for the likes’ last year. As we continue to\r\n            live our lives on social media with #outfitoftheday dominating our\r\n            timelines and celebrities relentlessly touting what’s hot and what’s\r\n            not, it may well be the answer to the throwaway culture that sits\r\n            all-too comfortably alongside this. Every second the world discards\r\n            a whole garbage truck full of clothing, so if we’re going to keep\r\n            expressing ourselves this way, we really ought not to be doing it at\r\n            the expense of our planet. ‘Throw-away culture is deeply rooted in\r\n            the fashion industry.

With 27% of Gen Z consumers now identifying as\r\n            non-conforming, is this about to change? When Harry Styles graced\r\n            the cover of Vogue last year wearing a gown, passionate\r\n            conversations around masculinity and gendered dressing were\r\n            instantly sparked. Representing Gen Z’s growing exploration of\r\n            gender-fluidity and non-binary dressing, the singer cemented his\r\n            place as the vanguard of neutral fashion.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Prominent conservatives were quick to voice their disapproval of a\r\n            cisgender celebrity engaging in progressive developments, however.\r\n            ‘The lines of what you should wear based on whether you’re ‘male’ or\r\n            ‘female’ are crumbling away,’ he told the publication. ‘I’ve never\r\n            really thought too much about what it means, it’s just this extended\r\n            part of creating something without limitations.’ ‘Bring back manly\r\n            men,’ tweeted political commentator Candace Owens. ‘In the west, the\r\n            steady feminisation of our men… is an outright attack.’\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            While this was a relatively standalone negative response (most were\r\n            delighted to see the pop culture icon dismantle societal\r\n            expectations for how people should present themselves) it highlights\r\n            how contested and divisive debates around gender expression have\r\n            become on a global scale. articularly regarding an industry which,\r\n            throughout history, has seen brands operate strictly within the\r\n            boundaries of standard gender categorisations. One that is only now\r\n            beginning to adapt. This sudden shift can be attributed to the power\r\n            of the Gen Z demographic, a consumer group that’s driving demand and\r\n            due to account for $143 billion in spending over the next few years.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default StyleDetail4;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport fifteen from \"./15.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst StyleDetail5 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/style\">Style</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg className=\"detail-img\" src={fifteen} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle>\r\n                Pride is different this year, with celebrations cancelled or\r\n                postponed.\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row  justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9 \">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Pride is different this year, with celebrations cancelled or\r\n            postponed. Even so, there are plenty of ways to show support by\r\n            donating to charities or shopping with brands who give back. Time is\r\n            up for performance activism. As young consumers, we are far more\r\n            aware of the philosophical values of the companies we choose to\r\n            purchase from than previous generations. Brands must now align their\r\n            values with ours, be vocal about their cause, and turn those values\r\n            into hard action – or face the music. Tokenistic marketing such as\r\n            ‘greenwashing’ and ‘pink-washing’ has been a common practice for\r\n            quite some time, particularly as social change becomes increasingly\r\n            favourable with the public.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Gen Z are acutely aware of which brands are genuine, however, and\r\n            can identify whose ethics have been shaped by a desire for truth,\r\n            transparency, and maximising opportunities for individual\r\n            self-expression. In 2021, rainbow branded products and social media\r\n            posts won’t fill the bill if brands aren’t doing anything to give\r\n            back to LGBTQ+ communities they claim to support. Luckily, there are\r\n            plenty of beauty companies who are putting their money where their\r\n            mouth is this Pride Month. We’re breaking down the list of brands\r\n            who have pledged to donate product sales to the community.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Well known LA-based make up brand Morphe has developed a limited\r\n            edition ‘Live With Love’ eyeshadow palette which includes a range of\r\n            25 vibrant hues.

Here’s why. Over the\r\n            course of the last 18 months, a plethora of headlines touting the\r\n            death of fast fashion (whereby trend-led clothing is mass-produced\r\n            to be sold at a reduced price on the high-street) have graced the\r\n            pages of newspapers, business journals, and fashion publications\r\n            across the globe. From ‘How Gen Z’s shopping habits could spell the\r\n            end of fast fashion,’ to ‘Gen Z is leading an evolution in shopping\r\n            that could kill brands as we know it,’ there’s been no shortage of\r\n            information regarding the potential demise of a sector renowned for\r\n            its negative impact on both people and planet.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Though there’s certainly method to the madness of course, these\r\n            reports are only correct to an extent. As ThredUP’s 2020 overview\r\n            revealed, the second-hand shopping market is indeed thriving – it’s\r\n            total worth set to hit $64bn in the next five years which will\r\n            ultimately far outpace fast fashion by 2029. And, with Gen Z and\r\n            millennials adopting conscious consumerism more than any other age\r\n            group, the future sure looks bright. We’ve also witnessed Forever21\r\n            file for bankruptcy, Arcadia go into administration, and H&M outline\r\n            plans to close 250 stores worldwide to instead increase digital\r\n            investment, all seemingly promising nods towards the beginning of\r\n            the end for fast fashion.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            It’s no doubt reassuring to see data like this amid continued\r\n            exposure to the industry’s dark side, but it overlooks one\r\n            unmissable fact: that fast fashion is, for countless complex\r\n            reasons, still booming. To begin with, despite shocking revelations\r\n            of malpractice at clothing factories owned by Boohoo last year, the\r\n            fast fashion giant’s sales actually rose by 45% between February and\r\n            August 2020.

This province’s name\r\n            is derived from Sindhu which means “an ocean” in the Sanskrit\r\n            language. The area has deep roots in Indus Valley Civilization which\r\n            was a Bronze Age civilisation and urbanized by the Dravidian\r\n            cultures in around 3000 BC. Sindh has a larger part of the desert\r\n            region and many natural resources. Sindhi culture is practiced by\r\n            the Sindhi people who are divided distributed among Pakistan, India\r\n            and diaspora. Their centuries-old history has given them strong\r\n            traditions, customs, folklore, distinct lifestyle and their own\r\n            language called Sindhi. But, their civilization has witnessed many\r\n            ups and downs and it got declined because of many natural disasters\r\n            like floods and most importantly the Indo-Aryan attack collapsed the\r\n            whole region. According to the history, British conquered Sindh in\r\n            1843 and till 1947, this province remained the part of British India\r\n            and later became part of Pakistan. The Sindhi language is an ancient\r\n            language and has solid and strong roots in Prakrit and Sanskrit.\r\n            Sanskrit is the Indian language that has Arabic, Persian, and\r\n            Dravidian’s vocabulary. The Sindhi language had always kept close\r\n            contacts with Arabic-speaking Muslims and so, this language has\r\n            adopted many words from Arabic. This language is spoken in many\r\n            other parts of Pakistan too.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            There are approximately 41 million speakers in Pakistan and 12\r\n            million speakers in India. This language is the 2nd most spoken\r\n            language in the country and mostly spoken in Sindh. It is one of the\r\n            recognized official languages in Pakistan as well as in India.\r\n            Moreover, the government of Pakistan issues its citizens the\r\n            National Card Identity in Sindhi or Urdu language. People of Sindh\r\n            are colorful and that depicts by their wholehearted celebrations of\r\n            Islamic and regional festivals. Folk dance of Bhagat is their\r\n            special dance that their professionals perform to entertain the\r\n            visitors. In simple words, this culture is a compound of music, folk\r\n            dances, and inexpensive entertainment for local people. Sindh has\r\n            always been considered the land of artistic values, romance, love,\r\n            peace, and great cultural values. There lived a great mystic Sufi\r\n            and the poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai. He spent his whole life\r\n            cherishing truth, wisdom, reality of life and in the propagation of\r\n            Islam. He also had been a great musician who invented several new\r\n            types of musical instruments such as, Tambura.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default CultureDetail3;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport twentyfour from \"./24.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst CultureDetail4 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/culture\">Culture</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg className=\"detail-img\" src={twentyfour} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"titling\">\r\n                It’s no-plastic July!

Alongside\r\n            urging big companies to change their current methods of plastic\r\n            production, we can all make subtle but impactful changes that reduce\r\n            plastic in our lives. Let’s get started!\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            1. Switch out plastic bottles for a reusable bottle: A major\r\n            contribution to plastic pollution is single-use water bottles. Metal\r\n            bottles like these will keep your drinks ice cold for the entire\r\n            day. With so many options, colours, and designs to choose from,\r\n            there’s one for everyone – continuing to buy plastic bottles is just\r\n            silly! 2. Buy a canvas tote bag to use when shopping: A reusable\r\n            tote bag is one of the easiest ways to cut down on your single use\r\n            plastic habit. They look good, they’re better for the environment,\r\n            and you can wash them as needed, too. If you’re only popping to the\r\n            shop for a few things, carry your items home if you can. 3. Bring\r\n            your own travel mug: Reusable coffee cups are not new, but many of\r\n            us still opt for a single-use cup when grabbing our morning tea and\r\n            coffee. A recent report says 7 million disposable coffee cups are\r\n            thrown out every day in the UK alone – that’s 2.5 billion each year.\r\n            We can do better! 4. Dodge unnecessary plastic cutlery: Many\r\n            eateries offer wooden utensils nowadays, but if you find your local\r\n            lunch spot still won’t ditch the plastic version, pop a fork and\r\n            knife from home in your bag.

All 6.2\r\n            million public school students in the state are free to join\r\n            regardless of family income. When classrooms reopen for the fall\r\n            term in California, all 6.2 million public school students will have\r\n            the chance to opt into their school’s free meal program for the\r\n            first time. This state-wide pledge has been made possible by an\r\n            unexpected $75 billion budget surplus largely from income tax\r\n            revenue, and $54 million has now been committed to offer free\r\n            lunches for the 2021-2022 fiscal year. Beyond that, a further $650\r\n            million has been set aside to cover the cost of breakfast and lunch\r\n            options throughout the following year. Gone at last are federal laws\r\n            that capped student eligibility at under $34,000 per household.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            While several US cities including New York, Boston, and Chicago have\r\n            provided free school meals for some years now, California’s proposal\r\n            is the first to go completely state-wide – challenging prior notions\r\n            that the prospect was too costly and unrealistic. California’s\r\n            director of food services, Erin Primer, has lauded the influx of\r\n            funding as ‘historic’ and ‘life changing’ not only in greatly\r\n            increasing the quantity of school meals, but also the quality. ‘The\r\n            extra funding will allow schools to offer tastier, better quality\r\n            food such as fresh bread, produce, and cheese from local producers,’\r\n            she said. At a time where the Golden State found itself flush with\r\n            cash, momentum to upscale food assistance was quickly seized upon\r\n            and driven by a coalition of school officials, lawmakers, charities,\r\n            and parents called School Meals for All.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default CultureDetail5;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport twentysix from \"./26.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst CultureDetail6 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/culture\">Culture</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg className=\"detail-img\" src={twentysix} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"titling\">\r\n                new species are being discovered by biologists all the time.\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row  justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9 \">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Research into new species by zoologists is essential in helping us\r\n            to protect the animal kingdom and adapt to climate change. This may\r\n            come as a surprise, but there’s a whole lot we don’t know about life\r\n            on Earth. In fact, new species are being discovered by biologists\r\n            all the time. While the last year may have felt uneventful for most,\r\n            scientists were busy naming and describing over 500 previously\r\n            unknown species of monkeys, insects, octopus, and more. Alongside\r\n            this, investigating how wildlife is managing the changes to their\r\n            natural environment – caused by human behaviour – has been critical.\r\n            It’s true the climate is changing faster than most animals can\r\n            adapt. For birds and mammals, biological adaptation such as heat\r\n            resistance and increased water retention are a long process.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The good news is many animals put up a decent fight – they’ll adapt\r\n            by changing their behaviours and pass the learned strategies over to\r\n            their young. Scientists have observed songbirds laying their eggs up\r\n            to two weeks earlier, timing the birth of their chicks with the\r\n            survival-window of their food, which is mainly made up of\r\n            caterpillars. This learned behaviour is necessary as insects evolve\r\n            quickly. As the caterpillar senses changes in its environment – such\r\n            as warming temperatures – breeding behaviours will be adjusted to\r\n            optimise its survival. Eagles are migrating earlier, moving to\r\n            cooler areas earlier in the year. Turtles have been seen adjusting\r\n            their routes for nesting and feeding due to altered ocean currents.\r\n            Such changed behaviour isn’t always successful. Continued stress on\r\n            environments has scientists questioning if we’re headed rapidly\r\n            towards the loss of over half of global species.,\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default CultureDetail6;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/31.e97bcf85.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/32.317bed5a.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/33.63892429.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/34.16b1ae4d.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/35.c361f19c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/36.8348fa27.png\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport thirtyone from \"./31.png\";\r\nimport thirtytwo from \"./32.png\";\r\nimport thirtythree from \"./33.png\";\r\nimport thirtyfour from \"./34.png\";\r\nimport thirtyfive from \"./35.png\";\r\nimport thirtysix from \"./36.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardSubtitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst Tech = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container-fluid\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Tech</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-md-4 col-xs-12 photo\">\r\n          <Link to=\"/techdetail\" className=\"linking\">\r\n            <Card>\r\n              <CardImg src={thirtyone} />\r\n              <CardBody>\r\n                <CardSubtitle>By Farhan Ali -

The\r\n            quantity of functioning protein cells termed cytokine – which rally\r\n            immune cells to the location of an infection – can assist the AI's\r\n            algorithm to generally determine when someone's immune system will\r\n            retire, according to research published this week in the Nature\r\n            Aging journal.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TechDetail2;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport thirtythree from \"./33.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst TechDetail3 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/tech\">Tech</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg src={thirtythree} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                China is all set to build the First Waterless Nuclear Reactor of\r\n                the World\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            Great To Love YouChinese government experts, according to sources,\r\n            have revealed a novel design for a commercial molten salt nuclear\r\n            reactor.

That’s\r\n            exactly what happened today, though, as Blue Origin launched its\r\n            first ever human flight to space successfully – Jeff himself\r\n            strapped inside a re-usable rocket called New Shepard. It is all\r\n            part of his efforts to fund space travel and make commercial rocket\r\n            ships a reality. Once you run out of things to sell on the ground\r\n            you might as well try your luck at the universe itself, eh? Jeff was\r\n            joined by his brother Mark Bezos, veteran space racer Wally Funk,\r\n            and an 18-year-old student. All four returned to the ground safely.\r\n            He joins a growing list of billionaire tech entrepreneurs eager to\r\n            get ahead in the competition for space tourism. Virgin CEO Richard\r\n            Branson took to the skies himself just a few days ago, beating Bezos\r\n            in speed but not altitude.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            There are a variety of reasons for the growing interest in space\r\n            travel. For one, it would give tech and travel companies such as\r\n            Virgin and SpaceX a significant advantage in a new market for\r\n            commercial space exploration. Being the first to provide public\r\n            seats inside rockets would be a big deal, and no self-respecting\r\n            billionaire wants to be seen missing out. Elon Musk has also said he\r\n            wants to eventually colonise nearby planets such as Mars and\r\n            believes humans shouldn’t be a ‘single planet species’. Whether you\r\n            view that as an abandonment of Earth – given the looming threat of\r\n            climate change – or a valiant attempt to broaden our galactic\r\n            ambitions is up to you. Billionaires also claim that their work in\r\n            this industry will help solve current problems down on the surface.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TechDetail5;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport thirtysix from \"./36.png\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Breadcrumb,\r\n  BreadcrumbItem,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardImg,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  CardTitle,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nconst TechDetail6 = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"row p-2\">\r\n        <Breadcrumb>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/home\">Home</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem>\r\n            <Link to=\"/tech\">Tech</Link>\r\n          </BreadcrumbItem>\r\n          <BreadcrumbItem active>Read</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n        </Breadcrumb>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row p-3\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-12\">\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <CardImg src={thirtysix} />\r\n            <CardBody>\r\n              <CardTitle className=\"paragraph\">\r\n                Celebrities, footballers, and many others have faced routine\r\n                abuse on social media for years\r\n              </CardTitle>\r\n            </CardBody>\r\n          </Card>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row justify-content-center\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-9\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            In September last year, an online petition was started by UK\r\n            celebrity Katie Price to make verified ID a requirement for opening\r\n            a social media account. This proposed legislation that would be\r\n            called ‘Harvey’s Law’. The petition was in reaction to the frequent\r\n            abuse and ableist attacks she receives online when posting about her\r\n            son Harvey and his condition, Prader-Willi syndrome. Price recalls\r\n            experiencing the ‘worst kind of abuse’ from online trolls, and\r\n            believes that new legislation will ensure that ‘no one can hide\r\n            behind their crime’.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Recently, the petition has seen a huge soar in support following the\r\n            defeat of England’s football team in the Euros final. The torrent of\r\n            racist abuse faced by the three Black English players on social\r\n            media caused understandable outrage and upset. Marcus Rashford,\r\n            Jadon Sancho, and Bukayo Saka’s social media accounts were inundated\r\n            with racial slurs, offensive messages, and abuse from anonymous\r\n            trolls and spam accounts. Attackers were able to get away with their\r\n            actions because there was no way of knowing who they were – meaning\r\n            any consequences were limited or non-existent.\r\n
